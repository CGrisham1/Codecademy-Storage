//Create a constant variable named entree and set it to equal to the string 'Enchiladas'.
const entree = 'Enchiladas';

//Just to check that you’ve saved the value of 'Enchiladas' to entree, log the value of entree to the console.
console.log(entree);

//Great, let’s see what happens if you try to reassign a constant variable.
//Paste the following code to the bottom of your program:

//entree = 'Tacos'

//This code throws the following error when you run your code:

//TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
