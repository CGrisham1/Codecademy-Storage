let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.';
//Great, now letâ€™s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below the console.log() statement, reassign newVariable to 1.
console.log(typeof newVariable);

console.log(typeof newVariable);
//Since you assigned this new value to newVariable, it has a new type! On the line below your reassignment, use console.log() to print typeof newVariable again.
console.log(typeof newVariable);
